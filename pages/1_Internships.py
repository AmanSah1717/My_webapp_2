            The project demonstrates how Machine Learning can predict flight 
            fares based on historical data (a supervised machine learning problem). 
            To obtain the best model performance, I have implemented a number of algorithms. 
            If you look at the core of the problem, based on the data, it is a regression problem. 
            There are a number of algorithms developed to tackle such issues, but to the context 
            of this report and based on the model accuracy to be as high as possible, 
            I have used LinearRegression, KNeighborsRegressor, RandomForestRegressor, 
            XGBRegressor, DecisionTreeRegressor, etc.
